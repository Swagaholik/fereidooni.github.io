            <p><strong>What's the purpose of this site?</strong> Traditional forms of social media and communications have been corrupted with capitalistic greed of conglomerates in big tech that have bred an unsafe place for youth to express themselves and communicate with one another. I may go on and on about this, but in short, (1) I do not want my personal data to be sold to third-parties I am unaware of; (2) I would like to reclaim my digital privacy; (3) I do not want big-tech capitalists to make money off my data points; (4) I wanted to maintain a decentralized platform for communications with all my friends, peers, colleagues, and the general population of folks interested by my life or sayings, and for them to still have a sense of my whereabouts physically and mentally. (5) I no longer want social media to influence my actions, behavior, emotions, and general state of mind in any way shape or form as it has rotted the Western world's perceptions of humanity far beyond control. <br>I highly recommend everyone to collectively reclaim their digital independence, privacy, and safety, and embark in a journey of creating their own personal website to communicate with others in a more healthy and controlled environment.</p>

            <p><strong>When are you on campus?</strong> Quite literally never (I am sorry!). I can try and arrange dates to visit you on campus but scheduling must be done weeks in advance. (As I'm typing this I realize how pretentious this sounds but I genuinely find it difficult coming to campus as I have built my entire work, school, research, extra-curriculars balance around a schedule that does not account for travel times. My life is more sustainable this way with the extra couple of hours I save per day avoiding travelling. Additionally, I recently got a bad haircut and need time to grow it out a little before I can be seen in public again.)</p>
