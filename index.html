            <p>I hope you are doing well! I am a current Master's student at the University of Washington studying Computer Science & Engineering.
                I will be attending the University of Cambridge for my PhD in Digital Humanities in autumn of 2024. I will be focusing my
                research on the impact of AI in the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia. I also have research interests in evaluating
                the commonsense reasoning of AI models. Outside of work, I enjoy playing chess (I suck).
