            <p> I hope you are doing well! I am a current PhD Student at the University of Cambridge.  
               My research focuses on the impact of AI in the sociopolitical arenas of the Global South, with 
               a particular focus on the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia. 
               I also have research interests in evaluating the commonsense reasoning of AI models. 
               Outside of work, I enjoy playing chess (I suck) and the guitar (I suck even more).
               <br>
               Previously, I had the utmost honor of receiving a Master's degree in Computer Science & Engineering, a BA in Sociology, and
               a BS in Computer Science with Data Science at the University of Washington.
